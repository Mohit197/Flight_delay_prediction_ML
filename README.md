## Introduction

As part of this project, the objective is to predict flight delays using PySpark. PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, enabling real-time, large-scale data processing in a distributed environment using Python. An ensemble of basic classification-based machine learning models, namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, will be experimented with to achieve this task. The ML model implementation will be done by interacting with Spark using the PySpark library.

## Problem Statement

Flight delays disrupt air travel and incur losses for airlines. Leveraging Machine Learning and Data Science, this project aims to accurately predict flight delays using datasets from open-source platforms like Kaggle.
