# Predict Flight Delays Using Machine Learning on PySpark

## Rutgers ECE 494/579 - Cloud Computing & Big Data (Fall 2023)

### By: Mohit Agarwal & Arslan Tariq

## Introduction

As part of this project, the objective is to predict flight delays using PySpark. PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, enabling real-time, large-scale data processing in a distributed environment using Python. An ensemble of basic classification-based machine learning models, namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, will be experimented with to achieve this task. The ML model implementation will be done by interacting with Spark using the PySpark library.

## Problem Statement

The project aims to predict flight delays using a dataset obtained from open-source data sites like Kaggle.
